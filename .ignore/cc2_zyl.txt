  What It Would Do (If It Existed)                                              
                                                                                
  This follows the create-* convention (like create-react-app, create-next-app) 
  which typically:                                                              
                                                                                
  1. Downloads and runs the package temporarily                                 
  2. Prompts you for project options (name, features, etc.)                     
  3. Scaffolds a new project with boilerplate code                              
  4. Sets up dependencies in package.json                                       
  5. Creates configuration files                                                
                                                                                
  The Package Doesn't Appear to Exist                                           
                                                                                
  My search didn't find a public create-agentic-app on npm. This could be:      
  - A private/internal package from a specific organization                     
  - A newly released package not yet indexed                                    
  - A hypothetical or planned package

  specific app?

  - Can run in background for parallel work

● Both agents are actively exploring:                                           
                                                                                
  Agent 1 (Structure) - Listing directories, searching for config files (.json, 
  .md, .ts)

  layout

  parallel to speed up the exploration.

  Would you like more details on any specific agent or how to use them          
  effectively?

  These agents in my earlier list are NOT native - they come from user          
  configuration or plugins:

  Plugin agents (from installed plugins like superpowers, backend-development,

  - Native agents: No prefix, always available                                  
  - User agents: No prefix, defined in your ~/.claude/agents/ directory         
  - Plugin agents: Have a prefix like superpowers:, backend-development:        
                                                                                
  You can check what's installed by looking at your ~/.claude/ directory or by  
  asking Claude Code directly.
